### Update Jan 16, 2022

Here's an update working toward the goal of an automated pH test, using a conventional chemical aquarium test kit. The video below shows that we're most of the way there!

	</video>

The stainless steel bowl represents the water tank to be tested, and the clear plastic container is a waste receptacle. A small-diameter pump 

In the demo, the water enters the testing chamber and then is removed. This could still leave some residue in the testing chamber.


The video speed is 10x -- so in reality it takes closer to 2 minutes to perform a test. We can speed that up quite a bit if necessary (for example, use a larger diameter pump for the testing solution, user a higher voltage for the water pump, etc.). But maybe it's okay if it takes that much time? 

Next steps: 

* Modify peristaltic pump design to be a bit looser (currently requires too much force, occasionally skips steps). Design reservoir to hold pH testing solution. 
* Design PCB to hold all electronics. How many pumps should it be able to power, eventually?
* Work on programming, image processing
