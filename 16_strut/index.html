        <h2>Strut-Climbing Robot</h2>
        <p>Entering its second year on the Rose Kennedy Greenway, a robotically fabricated structure created in part by Virginia Tech faculty and students has seen more than 1.2 million visitors and become a fixture near Rowes Wharf in Boston, Massachusetts. The experimental “Lo-Fab Pavilion,” which stands for “locally fabricated,” was erected on the greenway in July of 2015 as a featured public installation in the Design Biennial Boston.

        The pavilion will remain in Boston for the summer of 2016 alongside installations by internationally renowned artists as part of the Public Art Program hosted by the Rose Kennedy Greenway.

        Throughout the summer, the pavilion will be on exhibit along with Ai Weiwei’s “Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads,” Don Kennell’s “Monkey See,” Gianna Stewart’s “Midden,” Lawrence Weiner’s “A Translation from one Language to Another,” Matthew Hoffman’s “May This Never End,” and Carolina Aragon’s “High Tide.”
