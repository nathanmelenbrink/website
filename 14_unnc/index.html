        <h2>UNNC Pavilion</h2>
        <p>The images here show the result of a series of intensive workshops independently organized and conducted at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China campus. The students were taught from a basic understanding of 3D modeling to specific computational methods, including physics simulations, finite element analysis, and output for CNC fabrication, all with a focus on a final reciprocal frame pavilion to be constructed out of 18mm plywood without the use of hardware.  The pavilion was designed to host an opening ceremony and end-of-year exhibition to celebrate the first graduating class of of undergraduates in the school of architecture as well as the 10 year anniversary of the campus.  The United Nathans offered instruction and guidance throughout the process, both digital and physical (in the form of models and mockups), and worked with the students collaboratively to make design decisions for the exhibition space planning, as well as material considerations, notch joint adjustments, numbering and assembly strategies, etc. </p>

        <!-- A 3019 piece non-hierarchical surface structure extends in three parts through the atrium of the architecture school at University of Nottingham Ningbo Campus, shaping the spatial configuration of the 2014 Graduate Summer Exhibition and becoming a part of the exhibition itself. Forming the spatial design element of the exhibition the structure snakes through the space, enclosing and framing the students’ works. As the exhibition is covering four academic years of student works it grows and becomes more integrated and complex through the space, metaphorically following the development of students’ in their studies as they advance to higher levels. </p> -->
